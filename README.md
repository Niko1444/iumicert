> **Enhancing credential verification through verifiable academic micro-credential provenance using Verkle trees**

## 📖 Overview

IU-MiCert is a blockchain-based system designed to address critical limitations in current academic credential verification by implementing verifiable micro-credential provenance. The system leverages **Verkle tree technology** as an improvement over traditional Merkle trees to provide:

- 🛡️ Enhanced anti-forgery mechanisms through temporal verification
- 📈 Efficient storage and verification of granular learning achievements
- 🔗 Seamless integration with existing credential management systems
- ⏳ Comprehensive audit trail of learning achievements with verifiable timestamps

## 🎯 Motivation

Traditional credential systems fail to capture the rich mosaic of skills, projects, and competencies that constitute modern education. IU-MiCert addresses this by:

- Providing cryptographic verification of micro-credential sequences
- Preventing timeline manipulation and backdating of achievements
- Supporting the shift toward lifelong learning and skills-based assessment
- Serving as an upgrade to existing blockchain credential systems

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Current blockchain credential systems:

- Focus primarily on whole degree verification
- Lack efficient mechanisms for micro-credential management
- Create opportunities for credential forgery through timeline gaps
- Use Merkle trees that become inefficient at scale

IU-MiCert implements **Verkle tree structures** to address these challenges while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.
